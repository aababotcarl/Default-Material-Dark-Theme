[VS Code Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuchiu2002.default-material-dark-theme)

Material Theme Darker is one of my favortie minimalistic theme. However its default token colors palatte are very confusing in my opinion. For example, variables color are white, lots of token color are very saturated and so on. So I created this theme that combine Materail Theme colors with Default Dark + token colors.

Hope you find this combination of themes is enjoyable to code with!
